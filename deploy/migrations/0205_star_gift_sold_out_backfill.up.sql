-- Backfill the sold-out flag for limited gifts whose inventory was already
-- exhausted before the purchase/auction auto-flip landed. sold_out,
-- first_sale_date and last_sale_date share the TL flag, and the RPC layer only
-- exposes the sale timestamps behind sold_out, so an exhausted limited edition
-- with a stale revision rendered as sold out without its first/last sale dates.
-- The auto-flip has shipped in the store layers; this closes out any lingering
-- rows created before it went live.
